PIPELINE PROCESSOR DESIGN

1.	Introduction: 
A pipeline processor is an architecture that enhances processing speed by breaking down instruction execution into multiple stages. This method allows different instructions to be processed simultaneously at various stages, improving overall efficiency.

2.	Design and Methodology: 
A basic 4-stage pipelined processor is designed using Verilog, comprising the following elements:
1.	Instruction Memory – Stores program instructions.
2.	Register File – Contains general-purpose registers for storing intermediate values.
3.	Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) – Performs arithmetic and logical computations.
4.	Pipeline Registers – Transfers data between different pipeline stages to maintain smooth execution.

Instruction Set: 
The processor executes basic operations like: 
•	ADD, SUB for arithmetic operations. 
•	AND, OR for logical operations. 
•	BEQ, BNE for conditional branching. 

3.	Simulation:
